Here's an example of such a grammar that deals with the wonderfully ambiguous line \"I shot an elephant in my pajamas\".  The prepositional phrase \"in my pajamas\" can be attached to the verb  \"shot\" meaning I was wearing pajamas or attached to the non \"elephant\" meaning the elephant was wearing my pajamas. Both parses are equally valid gramatically speaking even though the attachment to the verb shot is the more probable."
